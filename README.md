# MLP-RBF networks
In this project MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks for 2D function regression are implemented from scratch.

## Description

For each network, three different optimization techniques are tested:
 - Full Minimization
 - Two blocks method
 - Decomposition method

For each method a detailed explanation is provided in the sections below.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies and Executing program

 - Check if Python 3.10 is installed on your machine 
 - Run the following command to install al the dependencies required for this project
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- To run a specific network of optimization technique, launch the command
```
python main.py
```
